    Pure Python implementation of `MorganLevineLab/methylCIPHER`.


Provides scikit-learn compatible "epigenetic clocks" for the common clock models provided by the `MorganLevineLab/methylCIPHER` R package. Essentially a pure python port of that package with some different design choices. Code is in a functional state for use in personal projects.

While packaged, this is not yet a release of any kind. Use at your own risk.
