# Critiques of minor errors in the literature

A list of mistakes in the literature that I've found. I'll try to keep this updated as I find more.

## In [^1]

1. authors define a transformation from chronological age to relative age, $\text{relative age} = F(\text{chronological age})$. Their model is thus written as $$F(\text{chronological age})= b_0 + b_1 \text{CpG}_1 + \cdots + b_p\text{CpG}_p + \text{error},$$ but in including an additive error term, this form confuses the realized relative age with a random variable relative age. This is a minor, but confusing, error.

2. authors write
    > The DNAm Age estimate is estimated in two steps. First, one forms a weighted linear combination of the CpGs ... The formula assumes that the DNA methylation data measure "beta" values but the formula could be adapted to other ways of generating DNA methylation data.

    yet (1) they do not specify the second step and (2) do not provide details or theoretical justifications for how the formula could be adapted to other ways of generating DNA methylation data.

1. authors write
    > We profiled 15,456 samples (Fig. 1A and table S1) using a methylation array platform that provides effective sequencing depth at highly conserved CpGs across mammalian species (5). This dataset is the product of the multinational Mammalian Methylation Consortium. In previous studies, we applied supervised machine learning methods to generate DNAm-based predictors of age called epigenetic clocks for numerous species (6-31).

    which points to references [6-31] for the epigenetic clocks. Looking at these references, it appears that all but 1 are for papers that each perform an identical analytical workflow, but in a different species. They were all published in 2021, 2022, or 2023. This strikes me as an egregious polluting of the primary literature with redundant papers, and it undercuts any novelty from the Science meta-analysis paper.

2. authors do not define "relative age".

1. in the associated code repository, the corresponding author responds to an issue request with[^4]
    > Hi Ellie
    Are you a team member from my collaborators?
    I have shared an important Dropbox folder with themâ€¦.

    This response does not help non-"team member" software users.

1. authors write very naively about statistical modeling,

    > Box 2 Statistical strategies for building DNA methylation-based estimators of biological age
    >
    > The development of a DNA methylation-based (DNAm) age estimator requires three major decisions: the statistical prediction method (for example, penalized regression), the outcome measure (that is, a surrogate marker of biological age) and the covariates (a subset of CpGs). **Alternative statistical methods are not likely to lead to substantial improvements because both theoretical and empirical studies show that elastic net regression works extremely well** when the number of predictors ($p$) is much larger than the number of observations ($n$).
    >
    > Larger sets of CpGs should in theory result in more accurate biomarkers. However, our empirical studies indicate that relatively little is gained by looking at ever larger sets of CpGs. **The reason for this phenomenon of diminishing returns is probably because DNAm biomarkers of ageing measure global properties of the methylome that can be characterized by moderate numbers of CpGs.**
    >
    > The multi-tissue DNAm age estimator uses chronological age as a surrogate for biological age because chronological age is highly correlated with biological age and is arguably a near-optimal surrogate of biological age during development. However, other outcome measures can lead to substantial improvements in regard to mortality and morbidity prediction in adults, as can be seen from the success of the DNAm phenotypic age (PhenoAge) estimator. **Defining biologically meaningful surrogate measures of biological age, beyond chronological age, is conceptually challenging because of the dangers of confounding.**
    >
    > Another strategy for developing more powerful DNAm estimators of organismal age consists of aggregating the DNAm age estimates of multiple organs. Future research should explore how to define powerful composite biomarkers of ageing on the basis of DNAm age estimates of different accessible tissues such as skin, buccal epithelium, and adipose tissue or fluids such as blood or urine.

    where emphasis is mine and footnotes have been omitted for clarity. Some of the errors here:

    - "covariates" is used incorrectly
    - "surrogate" is used incorrectly
    - general statements about high-dimensional learning are used to make strong, specific claims about a particular dataset
    - "diminishing returns" is not the correct description for lesser decreases in prediction error in high-dimensional learning
    - Confounding is only dangerous within a causal inference framework, which is not the framework used here. Confounding is not dangerous in a predictive framework. Causal inference considerations are immaterial to definitions of a "surrogate" unless an additional assumption is made about the instrumentation of the surrogate.
