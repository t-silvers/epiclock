Entropy Analysis

Entropy statistics were computed on methylation data adjusted for covariates and filtered for normality (see Computing Methylation Deviance). We computed the normalized Shannon entropy (Shannon and Weaver, 1963) of an individual's methylome according to the formula
where MFi is the methylation fraction of the ith methylation marker and N is the number of markers.
